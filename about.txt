Testing deploy with Vercel.

After some time, I realized the issues was at vercel.json / builds / src.
Refer to vercel.json file of this project to check the correct way.


Also, it is possible to test Vercel env without deploying, just use "# vercel dev".
The deployment is straight forward. After importing from github e settings DNS, each time a push is performed, the system will be updated.
***Need to heck it, because sometimes it will be unecessary or diseked.
