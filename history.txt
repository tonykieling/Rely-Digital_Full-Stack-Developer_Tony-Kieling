    app.get('*', (req, res) => {
      app.use(express.static('public'));
      return res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, './public', 'index.html'))
    });
  = had to return to original where app.use... is located at the begining of the file

- changed FE package.json
    no "proxy": "http://localhost:3334"

- index.js enabled cors

- rebuilded node_modules to both be and fe
    fe is getting issues, but eh fe file is already done - I'd like to rebuild it, but it did not work for now
